# Remove PDF Write Protection

This script removes PDF write protection. This is especially useful if you are
dealing with PDFs that you want to annotate, but are forced to copy, since the
original file forbids you to add annotations.

This script requires the presence of `/usr/local/bin/gs`, which can be installed
using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```
brew install ghostscript
```
